    <h2>What inspired the film?</h2>
    <br>

    <p>With such a wacky premise, it's no wonder so many come away questioning just why exactly someone would make a film about a bed that eats people. In an interview with Brian Albright for his novel <i><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/regional-horror-films-1958-1990-brian-albright/1111761691">Regional Horror Films,</a></i> George Barry said the idea came to him in a dreamâ€“ or rather, a nightmare. In the DVD commentary for the film, he mentions the work of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000339/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_6_nm_2_q_roger%2520corman">Roger Corman</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808542/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4_tt_0_nm_8_q_jack%2520smith">Jack Smith</a> as inspiration for his film. Corman and Smith were prominent filmmakers in the exploitation scene. <a href="https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/filmgenres/exploitationfilms">Exploitation film</a> capitalizes on aspects generally considered more lowbrow, like nudity and popular trends, to generate a profit at the box office. Many of these exploitation films are considered by critics to be low quality and unworthy of a critical eye, but a vast number of them go on to become cult classics. Barry sought to recreate the atmosphere of films like these in <i>Death Bed.</i></p>

    <h2>What's it <i>really</i> about?</h2>
    <br>

    <p>It's really just about a bed that eats people. That's <i>really</i> it. You could try to create a deeper interpretation, but there's not much to work with. That being said, most people who love <i>Death Bed</i> love it not because of an incredibly complex plot, but because of its unapologetic originality. Ask yourself: have you ever seen another movie about a bed that eats people? Of course not! We can safely say that when George Barry came up with that, it was a totally brand new idea. <i>Death Bed</i> was first released as a bootleg VHS in 1986, in a time when blockbuster franchise films were in their first heyday. Every other movie in theaters was a sequel or a spinoff of some sort. Much like today, audiences were yearning for something genuinely fresh and imaginative. Say what you will about <i>Death Bed,</i> and it's all valid, but you can't call it derivative.</p>

    <h2>What do critics think of <i>Death Bed?</i></h2>
    <br>

    <p>Unsurprisingly, the film is rather divisive. Some applaud its originality and uniqueness, while others claim it's garbage that should have been left to celluloid rot. To be fair, they're both kind of right. Even those who champion <i>Death Bed</i> often refer to it as "so bad it's good." Some critics have applauded the film's surreality, while others have criticized it for being pointless and confusing. In his review of the film for DVD talk, Adam Tyner had mostly negative things to say about the film, but finished off with a sentiment that many seem to share about the film: "On the other hand, <i>Death Bed</i> wields a strange and unique charm that kept entrancing me even when I was bored stiff. I'll always take an interesting failure over some uninspired, by-the-numbers horror flick."</p>
