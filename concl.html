<p>Death Bed: The Bed That Eats is an unquestionably unique film. Its mere existence invites discussion, both about its bizarre subject matter and its unconventional journey to official distribution. It raises questions about piracy: How can piracy help a film? Are there other films that have benefited from piracy? What if the things we've been told about piracy are wrong? These are important questions to consider, especially in a changing world where the cost of renting and buying films is increasing, and streaming services can remove original content from their catalogs, thereby making it completely unavailable to watch legally. We are entering an age where we may have to think critically about how we've come to conceptualize piracy, not only to continue to afford the recreation of watching movies, but also to ensure the availability of films in the future.
