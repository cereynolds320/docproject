        <p>Ever hear of a little film called <i>Death Bed: The Bed That Eats</i>?</p>
        <br>

        <p>No, I didn't think so. Most people haven't. <i>Death Bed</i> was written, produced, and directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1480386/">George Barry.</a> It was the only feature film Barry ever made. You can probably guess the film's plot: a bed is imbued with an evil hunger by a demon, and it goes on eating people for a century before finally being destroyed in an unsurprisingly sexual ritual. Barry had already spent most of his budget for the film when it came time to seek a distribution deal, so the film sat in a vault collecting dust for years.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Now this is where it gets really interesting. If everyone played by the rules, <i>Death Bed</i> would still be sitting in a dark storage facility, and no one would know it exists. Thankfully, some brave rebels entered the scene: the film eventually received bootleg VHS distribution in several countries, including England, Australia, and Spain. And then, in 2001, George Barry stumbled upon a review of his film online and discovered that it had, through years of being distributed illegally, accumulated some devoted fans. He was finally able, 24 years after the film's completion, to secure official distribution for the film. Nowadays, the film is available to stream on Kanopy and Amazon Prime, and occasionally, Turner Classic Films will show it as part of a horror film lineup. <i>Death Bed</i> is a fascinating film to discuss, not only for its content, but also for the remarkable manner in which it eventually made it to mainstream screens.
